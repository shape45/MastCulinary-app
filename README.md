## Project Overview
The **CulinaryFood App** aims to offer a simple, visually appealing platform for users to explore different recipes, save their favorites, and access cooking tips. With an intuitive navigation structure, users can switch between screens to access different parts of the app.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Login screen to authenticate users.
- **Recipe Listings**: A screen dedicated to showing various recipes.
- **Order & Payment System**: Simulated ordering and payment screens for a restaurant-style experience.
- **Confirmation Screen**: Order confirmation after successful payment.

## Requirements
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Expo CLI** (not globally installed; used locally through `npx`)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/culinaryfood-app.git
   cd culinaryfood-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Expo CLI** (if not already):
   > Note: The global `expo-cli` is deprecated, so we'll use `npx`.
   ```bash
   npx expo install
   ```

## Folder Structure
Here’s an overview of the main folders and files in the project:

```
CulinaryFood/
├── assets/                   # Asset files (images, fonts, etc.)
├── screens/                  # All screen components
│   ├── LoginScreen.tsx
│   ├── OrderScreen.tsx
│   ├── MenuScreen.tsx
│   ├── PaymentScreen.tsx
│   └── ConfirmationScreen.tsx
├── App.tsx                   # Main app entry file
├── package.json              # Package configuration and dependencies
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Usage
To start the project, use the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code or run it on an Android/iOS simulator.

### Common Errors
1. **ConfigError: Cannot resolve entry file**
   - Make sure the `"main"` field in `package.json` is set to:
     ```json
     "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"
     ```
   - Ensure that `App.tsx` or `App.js` exists in the root directory.

2. **Expo CLI deprecated warning**
   - Use the local Expo CLI with `npx` (e.g., `npx expo start`), rather than a global install of Expo CLI.

3. **Missing Expo Modules**
   - If prompted to install specific Expo modules, run:
     ```bash
     npx expo install <module-name>
     ```

4. **Node.js Version Compatibility**
   - Expo CLI may not work well with Node versions above 16. If you encounter issues, consider downgrading Node.js to a supported version (v14 or v
